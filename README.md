# uherotgr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package interfaces with the API provided by Title Guaranty. It returns a list of transaction records. Contact wood2@hawaii.edu for the API Key and Username. The API is only accessible from the UH network or the UH VPN. You may also use the API directly with any http tool or library of your choice, this package handles a few basics conveniently for you:
- batches the requests. The api itself has only a few fields to filter on, and will fail to respond if the requested time frame contains too many records. To handle this the tgr package allows you to specify any time frame, and will make requests to the api in small batches, reducing the load on their server and combining the responses into a single tibble. 
- Adds some additional filter options. The package allows you to select specific fields to include in your response. 
- Validates your field name inputs to ensure you're requesting fields that exist.

If you hit any bugs or see any room for improvement please open a github issue or slack Caleb and Vicky.
